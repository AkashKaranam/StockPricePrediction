# StockPricePrediction

This repository contains my attempt to replicate and validate the results found in this [paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/354289404_Stock_Price_Prediction_Using_Reinforcement_Learning). To run the code simply open the notebook in the repository in Jupyter Notebooks and load in the three csv's into your environment. Then you can run the notebook as normal from top to bottom.
